Parsing is a core process in handling and analyzing data from different file formats in programming. Hereâ€™s how parsing applies to formats like TSV, CSV, FASTA, FASTQ, PDB, and PDBsum:

1. **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**:
   - **Parsing** a CSV file means reading its rows and columns, separating each field by commas. Each line is parsed as a row, and commas determine the column values.
   - Example: `"Name, Age, Country\nJohn, 25, USA"` is parsed into a dictionary or table format.

2. **TSV (Tab-Separated Values)**:
   - TSV is similar to CSV but uses tabs instead of commas as delimiters.
   - **Parsing** involves splitting each line into fields based on tab characters (`\t`), making it easy to organize data into structured rows and columns.

3. **FASTA**:
   - FASTA files contain biological sequences, starting with headers (lines beginning with `>`) followed by sequence data.
   - **Parsing** FASTA involves reading each header and sequence as key-value pairs, where the header is the identifier and the sequence is the value.
   - Example: `">seq1\nATCG\n>seq2\nGCTA"` results in a dictionary like `{ "seq1": "ATCG", "seq2": "GCTA" }`.

4. **FASTQ**:
   - Similar to FASTA but also includes quality scores for sequencing reads.
   - **Parsing** FASTQ files requires reading each read block as four lines (header, sequence, separator `+`, and quality scores), organizing them by sequence and quality.

5. **PDB (Protein Data Bank)**:
   - PDB files store 3D coordinates of biological molecules.
   - **Parsing** involves extracting details such as atom names, residue names, chain IDs, and coordinates (`x, y, z`). Each `ATOM` or `HETATM` line represents an atom in the structure.

6. **PDBsum**:
   - PDBsum provides a summary of protein structures, often with sections for different types of molecular interactions or structural elements.
   - **Parsing** a PDBsum file involves identifying section headers (e.g., `###### Section Name ######`) and organizing information under each section as a list.

In each of these examples, **parsing** helps transform unstructured text data into structured formats (dictionaries, lists, tables) that are easy to work with in programming.
